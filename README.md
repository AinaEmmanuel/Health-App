# Health-App
HealthApp is a system built to bridge the communication gap between the students and the health centre at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta. 

The goal behind this system is to create a means for students to get quick response especially in times of emergencies, reducing the fatality rate in the process.

This repository holds the Front end code for the project that has three parts to it:
1. Client-side web for the health centre
2. Mobile app for the students
3. Alarm (IoT) system for the health centre
4. Server-side web application
 
Submission should be graded based on the **master** branch. However, we are committed to improving the project beyond what we have at submission for the Solutions challenge. Hence, new code will be pushed to the **staging**.
